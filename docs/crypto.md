# Cryptographic and Security Functions

Sprig provides a couple of advanced cryptographic functions.

## sha1sum

The `sha1sum` function receives a string, and computes it's SHA1 digest.

```
sha1sum "Hello world!"
```

## sha256sum

The `sha256sum` function receives a string, and computes it's SHA256 digest.

```
sha256sum "Hello world!"
```

The above will compute the SHA 256 sum in an "ASCII armored" format that is
safe to print.

## adler32sum

The `adler32sum` function receives a string, and computes its Adler-32 checksum.

```
adler32sum "Hello world!"
```
## bcrypt

The `bcrypt` function receives a string, and generates its `bcrypt` hash.

```
bcrypt "myPassword"
```

## htpasswd

The `htpasswd` function takes a `username` and `password` and generates a `bcrypt` hash of the password. The result can be used for basic authentication on an [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/misc/password_encryptions.html#basic).

```
htpasswd "myUser" "myPassword"
```

Note that it is insecure to store the password directly in the template.

## randBytes

The `randBytes` function accepts a count `N` and generates a cryptographically
secure (uses ```crypto/rand```) random sequence of `N` bytes. The sequence is
returned as a base64 encoded string.

```
randBytes 24
```

## derivePassword

The `derivePassword` function can be used to derive a specific password based on
some shared "master password" constraints. The algorithm for this is
[well specified](https://masterpassword.app/masterpassword-algorithm.pdf).

```
derivePassword 1 "long" "password" "user" "example.com"
```

Note that it is considered insecure to store the parts directly in the template.

## genPrivateKey

The `genPrivateKey` function generates a new private key encoded into a PEM
block.

It takes one of the values for its first param:

- `ecdsa`: Generate an elliptic curve DSA key (P256)
- `dsa`: Generate a DSA key (L2048N256)
- `rsa`: Generate an RSA 4096 key
- `ed25519`: Generate an Ed25519 key

## buildCustomCert

The `buildCustomCert` function allows customizing the certificate.

It takes the following string parameters:

- A base64 encoded PEM format certificate
- A base64 encoded PEM format private key

It returns a certificate object with the following attributes:

- `Cert`: A PEM-encoded certificate
- `Key`: A PEM-encoded private key

Example:

```
$ca := buildCustomCert "base64-encoded-ca-crt" "base64-encoded-ca-key"
```

Note that the returned object can be passed to the `genSignedCert` function
to sign a certificate using this CA.

## genCA

The `genCA` function generates a new, self-signed x509 certificate authority using a
2048-bit RSA private key.

It takes the following parameters:

- Subject's common name (cn)
- Cert validity duration in days

It returns an object with the following attributes:

- `Cert`: A PEM-encoded certificate
- `Key`: A PEM-encoded private key

Example:

```
$ca := genCA "foo-ca" 365
```

Note that the returned object can be passed to the `genSignedCert` function
to sign a certificate using this CA.

## genCAWithKey

The `genCAWithKey` function generates a new, self-signed x509 certificate authority using a
given private key.

It takes the following parameters:

- Subject's common name (cn)
- Cert validity duration in days
- Private key (PEM-encoded); DSA keys are not supported

It returns an object with the following attributes:

- `Cert`: A PEM-encoded certificate
- `Key`: A PEM-encoded private key

Example:

```
$ca := genCAWithKey "foo-ca" 365 (genPrivateKey "rsa")
```

Note that the returned object can be passed to the `genSignedCert` function
to sign a certificate using this CA.

## genSelfSignedCert

The `genSelfSignedCert` function generates a new, self-signed x509 certificate using a
2048-bit RSA private key.

It takes the following parameters:

- Subject's common name (cn)
- Optional list of IPs; may be nil
- Optional list of alternate DNS names; may be nil
- Cert validity duration in days

It returns an object with the following attributes:

- `Cert`: A PEM-encoded certificate
- `Key`: A PEM-encoded private key

Example:

```
$cert := genSelfSignedCert "foo.com" (list "10.0.0.1" "10.0.0.2") (list "bar.com" "bat.com") 365
```

## genSelfSignedCertWithKey

The `genSelfSignedCertWithKey` function generates a new, self-signed x509 certificate using a
given private key.

It takes the following parameters:

- Subject's common name (cn)
- Optional list of IPs; may be nil
- Optional list of alternate DNS names; may be nil
- Cert validity duration in days
- Private key (PEM-encoded); DSA keys are not supported

It returns an object with the following attributes:

- `Cert`: A PEM-encoded certificate
- `Key`: A PEM-encoded private key

Example:

```
$cert := genSelfSignedCertWithKey "foo.com" (list "10.0.0.1" "10.0.0.2") (list "bar.com" "bat.com") 365 (genPrivateKey "ecdsa")
```

## genSignedCert

The `genSignedCert` function generates a new, x509 certificate signed by the
specified CA, using a 2048-bit RSA private key.

It takes the following parameters:

- Subject's common name (cn)
- Optional list of IPs; may be nil
- Optional list of alternate DNS names; may be nil
- Cert validity duration in days
- CA (see `genCA`)

Example:

```
$ca := genCA "foo-ca" 365
$cert := genSignedCert "foo.com" (list "10.0.0.1" "10.0.0.2") (list "bar.com" "bat.com") 365 $ca
```

## genSignedCertWithKey

The `genSignedCertWithKey` function generates a new, x509 certificate signed by the
specified CA, using a given private key.

It takes the following parameters:

- Subject's common name (cn)
- Optional list of IPs; may be nil
- Optional list of alternate DNS names; may be nil
- Cert validity duration in days
- CA (see `genCA`)
- Private key (PEM-encoded); DSA keys are not supported

Example:

```
$ca := genCA "foo-ca" 365
$cert := genSignedCert "foo.com" (list "10.0.0.1" "10.0.0.2") (list "bar.com" "bat.com") 365 $ca (genPrivateKey "ed25519")
```

## encryptAES

The `encryptAES` function encrypts text with AES-256 CBC and returns a base64 encoded string.

```
encryptAES "secretkey" "plaintext"
```

## decryptAES

The `decryptAES` function receives a base64 string encoded by the AES-256 CBC
algorithm and returns the decoded text.

```
"30tEfhuJSVRhpG97XCuWgz2okj7L8vQ1s6V9zVUPeDQ=" | decryptAES "secretkey"
```

## pbkdf2hash

The `pbkdf2hash` function derives a key by applying a pseudorandom function to a given password and salt.

It takes the following parameters:

- Password (master password to derive the key from)
- Salt (sequence of bits)
- Desired number of iterations
- Desired key length of the derived key
- Hash-function to use. Supported values are:
  - sha1
  - sha224
  - sha256
  - sha384
  - sha512

```
pbkdf2hash "password" "salt" 4096 32 sha1
```
