# Documentation Getting Started

Documentation is written with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Python is required to build the documentation.

To setup a development environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

mkdocs serve
```
